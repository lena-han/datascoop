My name is Lena Han, and I am currently a student at Stanford University interested in politics, data, and art. The Data Scoop is a passion project of mine, where I write about current events by drawing conclusions from numbers and trends. Not only is data an intuitive way to understand patterns in the world, but it is also an accountability measureâ€”a way to combat sensationalism in the media. Please join me as I strive to explore news with depth and substance!

Feel free to contact me at lena.angela.han@gmail.com with suggestions, questions, and comments. In addition, my personal website can be found [here](https://lenahan.me/).
