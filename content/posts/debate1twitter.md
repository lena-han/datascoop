For the past decade, politics have become intertwined with Twitter as politicians have increasingly used the site to communicate their platforms, actions, and commentary. Through Twitter, we gain access to politicians’ most immediate messages—how else would we know that President Trump found the Democratic primary debates “Boring!”?

However, Twitter can also indicate the popularity of different politicians; looking at how the Democratic primary candidates’ follower counts changed over the past week gives an indication of how well they performed at the debates. 

Twitter followers are a useful metric because they combine two essential components of winning elections: name recognition and support. When voters are polled extremely early in the election cycle (i.e. now), the metric that most dictates support is name recognition. If only five percent of voters recognize the name “Jay Inslee,” it is quite literally impossible for Inslee to poll above five percent. Unsurprisingly, the two highest-polling candidates have been Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, also the two most well-known candidates. Similarly, people will only follow candidates on twitter if they know who the candidates are.

However, unlike name-recognition, following someone on Twitter is an active decision. Although things like media coverage alone are enough to improve a candidate’s name recognition, it takes some active interest to gain followers. The presidential debates had a clear impact on some of the candidates’ Twitter followings.

**A Few Caveats**

1.	Political twitter is not representative of the Democratic primary voters. Democratic twitter is overwhelmingly liberal and young; you would be hard-pressed to find much moderate political commentary on Twitter.<sup>1</sup> Consequently, support will be skewed away from candidates like Joe Biden. 

2.	The huge range of follower counts the different candidates have (ranging from Bernie’s 9 million to Micheal Bennet’s 25,000) makes it difficult to directly compare performance. Candidates who entered the debate with a massive twitter following naturally have a harder time drastically increasing their Twitter following.

Despite these caveats, the follower counts show clear winners from the two nights of debates.

**Each Candidate’s Increase Followers in the 12 Hours Following Their Debate**

First, I tracked the number of followers each candidate gained twelve hours after their respective debates concluded.
